2. Understand that the core team are complete javascript noobs. This is a learn in progress for all of us. Be warned and continue to the next step only if you are comfortable with this. Unless you are that amazingly beauitful women, then continue regardless.

3. That being said, we will also try to provide you with sufficient help to get started on this project. For those who are more experienced, we welcome you to take the stage by storm.
